# FCCLA Organ Control
<p1>
A set of RNBO patches targeting Raspberry Pi to allow the organ to control an Integra-7 synth via pressing thumb pistons.
Organ is running Multisystem SSOS 2 and outputs MIDI sysex on stop changes. RNBO associates a set of stops to an integra set 
and once those particular stops are activated, the corresponding set is fired off on the synth. User has control to freely
record sets to thumb pistons.
